          <p>
            Struggling to find my purpose, I spent some years desperately trying
            to discover my passion. Without a hope, I enrolled in a Bachelor of
            Information Technology at AIT college, Sydney , Australia. I started
            learning code and got comfortable with some basics. I realized that
            I have never been so joyful than the moment when I successfully
            wrote a relatively complicated feature that I wasn't sure I could
            pull off. It feels like I just ‘leveled up’ . Finding the bugs and
            resolving a bug that I’ve never dealt with before, feels me smarter
            afterwards. With all of these contentments, I never stopped learning
            new programming skills and languages. This passion has since lasted
            and lead to my decision to become a successful developer. Early I
            started creating websites for friends and just for fun as well. As a
            self-taught developer, I enjoy learning development more than any
            other fields. Beside that, I have a passion for fitness. I regularly
            workout to keep me fit, maintain self-confidence and to stay
            motivated towards my goal.

            I have build dozens of small projects for some practice and created
            some large projects for a business solution like ecommerce
            application and project management application. Technologies that I
            mostly used for front-end are HTML, CSS, SASS, React, Redux,
            React-Native, etc. And, for backend I mostly use NodeJs, Express,
            MongoDB, MySQL, etc.
